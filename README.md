# Utils for Python

Often I need to plot things with matplotlib. This library defines 
utility functions for example for this usecase.


install with

```
pip install git+git://github.com/534ttl3/ctsutils.git --upgrade
```

or, if you intend to develop it on your local machine, first pull it from github, e.g.:

```
cd ~/Dropbox/1Projects/programming/
git clone git@github.com:534ttl3/ctsutils.git

# ... maybe activate a virtual environment ...

# install the package in editable mode in your virtual environment
# to be able to modify it and push it back to github
pip install -e ./ctsutils/
```
